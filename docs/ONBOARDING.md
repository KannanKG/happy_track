// Good: Clear variable names and comments
const testRailActivities = await fetchUserActivities(userIds, dateRange);

// Good: Type definitions
interface UserActivity {
  userId: string;
  activity: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Good: Error handling
try {
  const result = await apiCall();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API call failed:', error);
  throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');
}
```

### Testing Your Changes
